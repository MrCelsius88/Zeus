# The Zeus Game Engine.
This is just a little game engine I am developing to learn the basics of engine, graphics, and video game programming.
The engine is coded in C, because I enjoy the simplicity and control. 

## Notes
- I am developing the engine on Linux, so there is no pre-made windows build script. However I am trying to keep the engine cross platform, so  if you **are** interested in using the engine, then it really is just a matter of converting bash to batch, at least, I hope so.

- You can do whatever you want with the code, all I ask is that in my effort to learn more and become a better programmer if you find **ANYTHING** that I can improve on please do not  hesitate to open an issue/pull requests detailing how something could be improved.

Thanks to all the members of the [Handmade Community](https://handmade.network/) for inspiring me to build this engine, and to become a better programmer.
